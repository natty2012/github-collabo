# GitHub collabo
To a great start and collaborations on GitHub with you all..super-excited! :-)

# Learning bits
- What is GitHub?

- Is a Repository like a folder? Let's learn how to create one

- What about a Commit- is it like "save as"?

- Let's make our first commits-I think some branches will be needed

- How do we make changes on a file as contributors?: PR, not Public Relations but Pull Request! :-)

- Looking at PRs: opening, merging and reviewing
